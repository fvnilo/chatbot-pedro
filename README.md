chatbot-pedro
=============
This is a simple experiment on building a chatbot with PyAIML. All I want is:

* Clever replies;
* Subject and keyword memory;
* Knowledge about many human subjects such as love, life, relationships, etc.
* Web-based

You will need:

* Python 2.7
* PyAIML
* PyYAML (for the settings)
